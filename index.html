    <h2 id="welcome">Welcome to ChemWriters!</h2>

    <p> ChemWriters is a student group in the 
    <a href="http://web.mit.edu/chemistry" title="MIT Department of Chemistry">
    MIT Department of Chemistry</a>.  We are dedicated to a simple notion: 
    “<em>writing is hard, so why not make it easier</em>?” We think that one 
    effective way to make writing easier is to bring writers together into a
    common, quiet, productive space. The presence of other writers being
    productive is self-reinforcing motivation for everyone.  People come
    together, and everyone benefits. Oh yeah, and free coffee and snacks never
    hurt.</p>

    <h3 id="sessions">Sessions</h3>
    <p>ChemWriters meets:</p>

    <p class="important">
      Mondays and Wednesdays, in the Moore Room
      (<a href="https://floorplans.mit.edu/pdfs/6_3.pdf"
        title="Building 6 third floor plan (needs certificates)">6-321</a>), 
      from 1 – 5 <br />
      Starting <em>March 13, 2012</em> and going at least until May 28, 2012.
      <a href="static/chemwriters.ics" title="Download an iCal event for all session times">
        <img style="float: right" class="icon" alt="iCal event for all session times" src="img/calendar.png" />
      </a>
    </p>

    <p>There are three known exceptions: there will be no session on Wed. April
    25, and Wed. May 5; the session on Mon. April 2 will be from 2 – 6. Feel
    free to come for any amount of time, but please <a href="#rsvp">RSVP</a> if
    at all possible to help us devote the right amount of resources.</p>

    <h3 id="rsvp">RSVP</h3>
    <p>Because ChemWriters is a new activity, there‘s still a lot to learn
    about how popular it is and members' attendance. To help us prepare better,
    we ask that you RSVP for ChemWriters sessions you intend to attend with the
    date and your expected hours of attendance. You also ensure your spot this
    way: in the unlikely event that there are space constraints, people who have
    RSVPd for that day receive priority.</p>

    <p class="important">To RSVP, send an email to 
    <a href="mailto:chemwriters@mit.edu?Subject=RSVP&amp;body=I%20plan%20to%20attend%20the%20ChemWriters%20session%20on%20%3CDATE%3E%20from%20%3CSTART%20TIME%3E%20to%20%3CSTOP%20TIME%3E.">
      chemwriters@mit.edu</a> with the date and time you expect to attend.</p>

    <h3 id="posters">Posters</h3>
    <p>If you want to let others know about ChemWriters, you can put
     up one of our posters, available in 
     <a href="static/cw_poster.pdf">grayscale</a>,
     <a href="static/cw_poster_blue.pdf">blue</a>,
     <a href="static/cw_poster_magenta.pdf">magenta</a>, and
     <a href="static/cw_poster_green.pdf">green</a>.</p>


    <h2 id="policies">Logistics</h2>

    <h3 id="quiet">Quiet</h3>
    <p>A quiet environment is essential to the nature of ChemWriters. Quiet
    conversation is allowed, but please silence mobile devices, use headphones
    with computers, be aware of others, and do not hesitate to notify someone
    if their noise level is interfering with your ability to concentrate. The
    need for a quiet environment is the fundamental ground rule, and everyone
    present plays an important rule in enforcing it.</p>

    <h3 id="breaks">Breaks</h3>
    <p>At the start of every hour, 5 minutes will be devoted to a “break” time.
    During this time, there are no noise restrictions, and it’s probably a good
    idea to leave your seat and move around if you haven’t done so on your own
    recently.</p>

    <h3 id="sign-in">Sign-in</h3>
    <p>In order to help us improve ChemWriters, we ask that you sign in and out
    when you arrive and leave. The sign-in sheet is located next to the food.
    If you would like to add your email to the mailing list, the sign-in sheet
    provides an opportunity to do that as well.</p>

    <h3 id="priority">Priority</h3>
    <p>In the highly unlikely event that attendance at a ChemWriters session
    exceeds the space constraints of the room, we have developed a priority
    hierarchy to make the resource usage as fair as possible. Priority will be
    assigned in the following order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Chemistry students working on theses with RSVPs</li>
      <li>Chemistry students working on papers with RSVPs</li>
      <li>Chemistry students working on theses without RSVPs</li>
      <li>Chemistry students working on papers without RSVPs</li>
      <li>Non-Chemistry “guest” students</li>
    </ol>
